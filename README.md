# management-system
creating a program for a small business to help it manage tasks assigned to each member of the team. This program will work with two text files, user.txt and tasks.txt. 
In tasks.txt store a list of all the tasks the team is working on. Open
this file and review the contents. Note that this text file already
contains data about two tasks. The data for each task is stored on a
separate line in the text file. Each line includes the following data
about a task in this order:
■ The username of the person to whom the task is assigned.
■ The title of the task.
■ A description of the task.
■ The date that the task was assigned to the user.
■ The due date for the task.
■ Either a ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ value that specifies if the task has been
completed.
In user.txt store the username and password for each user that has
permission to use your program (task_manager.py). Open the
user.txt file and review the contents. Note that this text file already
contains one default user that has the username ‘admin’ and the
password ‘adm1n’. Write the username and password for each user
to this file in the following format:
■ The username followed by a comma, a space, and then the
password
■ Only record one username and corresponding password per
line.
program should allow users to do the following:
○ Login. Prompt the user to enter a username and password. A list of
valid usernames and passwords is stored in the user.txt text file.
Display an appropriate error message if the user enters a username
that is not listed in user.txt or enters a valid username but not a
valid password. The user should repeatedly be asked to enter a valid
username and password until they provide appropriate credentials.
The following menu should be displayed once the user has
successfully logged in:
     r - register user.
     a - add task.
     va - view all tasks.
     vm - view my tasks.
     e - exit.
○ If the user chooses r to register a user, they should be prompted for
a new username and password. The user should also be asked to
confirm the password. If the value entered to confirm the password
matches the value of the password, the username and password
should be written to user.txt in the appropriate format.
○ If the user chooses a to add a task, they should be prompted to
enter the username of the person the task is assigned to, the title of
the task, a description of the task, and the due date of the task. The
data about the new task should be written to tasks.txt. The date on
which the task is assigned should be the current date. Also, assume
that whenever you add a new task, the value that indicates whether
the task has been completed or not defaults to ‘No’.
○ If the user chooses va to view all tasks, display the information for
each task on the screen in an easy-to-read format.
○ If the user chooses vm to view the tasks that are assigned to them,
only display the tasks that have been assigned to the current user
in an easy-to-read format.
